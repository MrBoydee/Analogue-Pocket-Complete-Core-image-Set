Shares some artwork from  <a href="https://github.com/MegaZXretro/Analogue-Pocket-Custom-Platform-Art" target="MegaZXretro">MegaZXretro</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images" target="dyreschlock">dyreschlock</a> both of which are more talented then I am. 

I just wanted to fill out the rest of the core art so it had a more cohesive and uniform look. Made changes where I could.

All artwork was made useing the amazing tools in the Pocket-Sync app by <a href="https://github.com/neil-morrison44/pocket-sync" target="neil-morrison44">neil-morrison44</a>
